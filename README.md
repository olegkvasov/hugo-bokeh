# Hugo Bokeh Theme

## Installation

First of all, install Hugo. See [Hugo guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for more information.  

Recommended install this theme with git submodule:

> That way you can get new updates

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/olegkvasov/hugo-bokeh.git themes/bokeh
```

You can also download the archive directly from Github and extract it inside your project to the **themes** folder.

After that, open your hugo.toml file and specify the bokeh theme as the main theme:

```toml
theme = "bokeh"
```
